# session storage

used less often than localStorage
properties and methods are same as localStorage but:

1. the sessionStorage exists only within the current browser tab. another tab with same page will have a different storage.

2. the data survives page refresh, but not closing/opening tabs


## storage events:

when the data gets updated in localStorage or sessionStorage, storage event triggers with these properties:

1. key -> the key
2. oldValue -> previous value
3. newValue -> new value
4. url -> page url
5. storageArea -> local or session storage


we can listen the onstorage event of window which is triggered when updates are made to the same storage from other documents.
