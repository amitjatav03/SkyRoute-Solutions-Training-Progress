# local storage

local storage is a web storage object which are not sent to server with each request.
this data services a full web page refresh and even a full browser restart.

the methods provided by local storage:

1. setItem(key, value) 
    store key value pair

2. getItem(key)
    get the value by key

3. removeItem(key)
    remove the key with its value

4. clear()
    delete everything

5. key(index)
    get the key on a given position

6. length
    the number of stored items


## we can get and set values like an object

localStorage.one = 1

alert(localStorage.one)

delete localStorage.one




** important notes **

1. both key and values must be strings
2. we can use the two json methods to store objects in lo0cal storage:

JSON.stringify(object) 
    converts objects to JSON strings

JSON.parse(string)
    converts string to objects
