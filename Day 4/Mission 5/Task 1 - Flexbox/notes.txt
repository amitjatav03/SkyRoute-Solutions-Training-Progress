Flexbox -> 1-D Layout Method
    -> Flexible-box
Powerful tool that is used to create layouts of a website
We can create layouts horizontally or vertically aligned

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.


Terminologies:-
(by default)
horizontal axis -> main axis
vertical axis -> cross axis

parent element -> flex container
child elements -> flex items


To create flex container
    display: flex;
and child elements will become flex items


* When we mark a container --> display: flex;
by default -> flex-direction: row;
by default -> flex-wrap: nowrap;


flex-direction -> row -> main axis - horizontal
               -> column -> main axis - vertical


Shorthand Notation:-
 flex-flow: row wrap-reverse; 


Properties for flex container:-

Justify Content:-
justify-content -> main-axis ke accordingly cheezon ko place karta hai
values -> start, end, center, 
        space-around, space-evenly, space-between


Align Items:-
align-items -> cross-axis ke accordingly cheezon ko place karta hai
values -> flex-start, flex-end, center
        start, end, stretch

by default -> align-items: stretch;


Align content:-
align-content -> used to manage spacing between items when they are wrapped
align-content: start;



Properties for flex items:-

order -> used to change sequence for flex items

flex-shrink -> specify item's shrink speed
eg.
flex-shrink: 4; 
then the particular flex item will shrink x4 more speed than other flex items

flex-grow
- flex-items will take full space available
- the flex-grow css property sets the grow factor, which specifies how much of the flex container's remaining space should be assigned to the flex item's main size.


flex-basis 
- used to set initial dimension of flex items


align-self
- The align-self css property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value.
- In grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area.
- In Flexbox, it aligns the item on the cross side.
values -> flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch


Shorthand Notation
flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;
