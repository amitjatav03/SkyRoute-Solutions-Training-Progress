# SMARTSKY 


## What is SmartSky?

You have a big box of letters (emails) you want to send to lots of people.

But you’re just one person, and sending one letter at a time to everyone takes forever! 😩

So… you build a smart robot helper called SmartSky 🤖📧


## What does SmartSky do?

1. You give it a list of friends (names + emails in a file).

2. SmartSky sends a nice email to each one. ✉️😊

3. Then it waits to see if anyone replies.

4. If someone replies, SmartSky says: “Yay! This friend wants to talk!” 🎉 and saves them as a special friend (a lead).

5. If someone doesn’t reply, SmartSky tries again — up to 4 times.

6. If still no reply, SmartSky says: “Hmm… maybe this friend is busy” 😴 and stops trying.


In the end…
SmartSky makes a new list of all the friends who replied 📋✨
So you know who’s really interested and want to talk more.

That’s it! 💙
You're using a smart robot to send emails, watch who replies, and remember the important ones — all by itself!
