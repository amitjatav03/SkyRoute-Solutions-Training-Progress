# **SmartSky - CRM Automation Tool**

## **Meet You and Your Robot**

Imagine you are a kid with a robot friend named **SmartSky**.

You want to invite your friends to your birthday party — but there are too many friends, and you can’t call everyone yourself!

So, you tell SmartSky:

> “Hey Robot, here’s a list of my friends and their addresses. Please send them my party invitation!”

---

## **What does SmartSky do?**

You give SmartSky a list like this:

| Name  | Email                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| Meena | [meena@abc.com](mailto:meena@abc.com) |
| Raju  | [raju@abc.com](mailto:raju@abc.com)   |
| Bunty | [bunty@abc.com](mailto:bunty@abc.com) |

SmartSky reads it like:

> “Okay! I will send your birthday card to Meena, Raju, and Bunty!”

---

## **Then what happens?**

### Step 1:

SmartSky sends **Party Invitation 1** to all your friends:
**“Hi Meena! You're invited to my party!”**

### Step 2:

SmartSky waits for their reply...

## **Examples of What Happens Next:**

* **Meena replies:**
  “Yay! I’m coming to the party!”
  → SmartSky says: “Great! Mark Meena as coming.”

* **Raju doesn’t reply:**
  → SmartSky says: “Hmm… maybe he didn’t see it. I’ll send him another message.”

* **Bunty still doesn’t reply after 4 messages:**
  → SmartSky says: “Bunty may not want to come. I’ll stop now.”

---

## **In the End… SmartSky gives you a new list:**

| Name  | Status     |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Meena | Coming     |
| Raju  | No Reply   |
| Bunty | Not Coming |

---

## **What did SmartSky do?**

* 📬 Sent messages for you
* 📥 Checked who answered
* 📝 Made a new list of friends who want to come
* 🤖 All by itself!

## **Now think of it like a Business**

Instead of a birthday party, a company wants to talk to customers.

SmartSky helps by:

* Sending emails automatically
* Watching who replies
* Marking who is interested
* Giving a final report

**That’s what your SmartSky CRM Automation Tool does — it’s a smart helper that talks to people for you!**
